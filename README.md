# Design-Patterns-Practice
Repository for practicing Design Patterns

Supplementary material for the [Design Patterns](https://www.coursera.org/learn/design-patterns) course, from the one I took in Coursera.
This is based on the [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrhzvIcii6GNjpARdnO4ueTUAVR9eMBpc) created by [Christopher Okhravi](https://www.youtube.com/c/ChristopherOkhravi) referencing the book [Head First Design Patterns](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-design/0596007124/) (_can't buy the book, I'm poor_)
